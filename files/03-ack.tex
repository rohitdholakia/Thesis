\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I am lucky to have a lot of people to thank. 

This dissertation would not be possible without my advisor, Dr. Anoop Sarkar. He let me choose a topic that got me excited, helped me through the lows and highs and his door is always open for guidance, advice and enlightment. It has been a joy to work with him. 

Without my Mom, I would have never dreamt of coming to Vancouver from a small town in rural India. She always told me to dream and work equally hard towards them. This dissertation and everything before and after is dedicated to her. 

To Sudha for standing by me all these years through thick and (quite a bit of) thin. Thanks for waiting and I hope you don't have to wait much longer. 

Thanks to my friends at SFU for humouring my sense of humour and being happy victims of my amateurish cooking skills.
