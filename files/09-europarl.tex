\chapter{Detour: Europarl}
\label{chap:europarl}

\section{What is Europarl?}
Europarl refers to the parallel corpora generated by translating the proceedings of European parliament into several languages. Version 7 of Europarl now has 20 languages, from French to Estonian and Finnish. Release of the Europarl corpus led to a surge in research into more and more data-driven methods to enable Statistical Machine Translation. The results were easily reproducible and the data is very clean and sentence-aligned. 

Moreover, Europarl is multi-parallel. What does multi-parallel imply? Consider english as the common target language. A multi-parallel corpora between 20 European languages and English comprises sentences in 20 european languages which translate to the same english sentence.

\section{How best to simulate low-resource?}

~\cite{Cohn:07} simulated ``low-resource'' settings by using the top 10K sentences for the source pivot, pivot target and source target systems.
